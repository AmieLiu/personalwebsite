The following is a selection of projects I have worked on that showcase my skills and expertise in user experience design and digital product development. Each project demonstrates my ability to conduct user research, analyze data, develop user personas, create wireframes and prototypes, and iterate designs based on user feedback. These projects not only highlight my proficiency in various UX design tools and methodologies but also reflect my dedication to delivering innovative and user-centric solutions across diverse digital platforms.
