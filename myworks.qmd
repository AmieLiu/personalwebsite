title: "My Works"

My name is Amie Liu, a university student and UX designer based in Toronto, Ontario. Drawn to the intersection of technology and human interaction, I started my journey with a major in **Global Business and Digital Arts** and a minor in **Computing** at the University of Waterloo. Then, I delve into courses that provide a solid foundation in design principles and user research in the **Bachelor of Information** program at the University of Toronto.\
\
In my professional life, I follow the philosophy that good design is not just about aesthetics but is about an iterative process that solves a problem. I believe the power of **user-centric design** will create meaningful experiences and help communities. When I am not immersed in the world of pixels and prototypes, you can find me swimming, resting on the beach, cooking new recipes, and traveling to different places.
