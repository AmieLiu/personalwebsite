    "text": "My name is Amie Liu, a university student and UX designer based in Toronto, Ontario. Drawn to the intersection of technology and human interaction, I started my journey with a major in Global Business and Digital Arts and a minor in Computing at the University of Waterloo. Then, I delve into courses that provide a solid foundation in design principles and user research in the Bachelor of Information program at the University of Toronto.\n\nIn my professional life, I follow the philosophy that good design is not just about aesthetics but is about an iterative process that solves a problem. I believe the power of user-centric design will create meaningful experiences and help communities. When I am not immersed in the world of pixels and prototypes, you can find me swimming, resting on the beach, cooking new recipes, and traveling to different places.\n\nTools: Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe Creative Suite, Miro, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Racket, R Studio\nTechnical Skills:Prototyping, Wireframing, User Research, Usability Testing, Design Thinking, Interaction Design, Usability Principles, Affinity Diagramming, Information Architecture\nSoft Skills: Collaboration, Problem-Solving, Self-Management, Critical Thinking, Organization, Communication, Adaptability, Analytical, Creativity, Facilitator Skills"
